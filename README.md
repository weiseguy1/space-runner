## About
This game was inspired by Clear Code's [tutorial](https://youtu.be/AY9MnQ4x3zk) on Pygame. The code contains
notes in the form of comments on how to work with basic logic in Python 

- if statements
- while loops
- and classes

as well as how to work with external libraries. 

The original code made by Clear Code can be found [here](https://github.com/clear-code-projects/UltimatePygameIntro).
